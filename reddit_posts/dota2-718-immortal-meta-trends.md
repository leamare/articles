This data is based on Immortal Ranked Trends report for patch 7.18. It includes most of ranked matches that were played on Immortal rank in patch 7.18 (except ones that had abandons, ended in less than 10 minutes or had insignificantly low score).

Positions data may be inaccurate in some way (mostly so that very bad core games are counted as support while supports who had high stats and didn't spent much on support items may be considered core), but it's most likely to be insignificant.

Full report is available [here](https://spectralalliance.ru/reports/?league=imm_ranked_718). You can look through data by yourself if you want, maybe you'll find something interesting as well. There are more detailed data about Hero VS Hero performance, Draft stages priorities, pairs and trios, positions stats and dire/radiant winrates, Meta Graph and region spacific data.

New features that you may find interesting:
* Regions data with all the graphs, combos, records and other stuff
* Records for big player number leagues
* Lane Combos section
* Immortal Treasure III

# Short FAQ

* **Why so little matches played in REGION NAME?** On higher ranks it's common to queue for game on closest popular region. I.e. EUW for RU players, USE for USW.
* **Where did you get data?** I've got match IDs manually extracted from leaderboards players' recent matches.
* **What criteria are used?** Average rank for every game should be at least Divine 5. That's all.
* **Why there are only random draft matches played in China?** They just like playing random draft ever since DotA All-Stars days.
* **What does banned winrate mean?** It's winrate of a player (and his team) who nominated a hero for ban.
* **Can I see individual players stats somewhere?** Techically - yes. But there are too much players, reports are getting too big and unreadable because of that.
* **What is Hero Pairs Divergence?** It's the difference between expected pair's matches and real match number. Usually this difference is higher for better hero combos.
* **Why there're three times less matches than was in Divine 5 Meta Trends?** Keep in mind, it's only start of the season. And overall it's *Immortal* rank with exclusively leaderboard players against *Divine 5*.

1. It seems like NP wasn't feeding intentionally. Altho, EUW deaths record was set by intentional feeding by a NP player as well.

# Notable facts

* Mirana is pretty interesting. She's not one of the top contested heroes, but she became pretty popular as an offlane core recently. She was buffed a lot before that and a lot of high tier players tried to make carry potm work, but something went wrong. Interesting part is that Mirana + strong support have 54%+ winrate in offlane (you can check it on Lane Combos page)
* Necrophos doesn't really work as a safelane core, but holy shit, 55.58% winrate on mid and 56.51% as offlane core
* Centaur is similar. He wasn't really contested recently, but he has 55%+ winrate on every position except support

I'm finishing my LRG v.2.0.0 with huge code improvements and some new features like Regions data and other things. I'll try to generate a report for TI contenders during last 2-3 months this week.

Thanks to [OpenDota](https://opendota.com/) and [STRATZ](https://stratz.com/) for providing awesome APIs to grab all juicy match analysis data and generate stats for all the matches.

And huge thanks to my Patreon pledger *Speedy Gonzales*. Your support helps to keep up.
