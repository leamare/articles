The first Pro Circuit season ended and it's time to look back and see what was the meta of this competitive year.

As always, you can check all things out in [full version of the report on the website](http://spectralalliance.ru/reports/?league=pro_circuit_s1_lans). It's hard to get all the juicy data into one reddit post.  I'd suggest you to look over Hero Positions overview, Hero Averages, Players Summary table, Heroes Summary, Teams Summary and Team vs Team sections. There are also cool charts and teams profiles available. Check it out! ~~I am really proud of what I made~~

**BEWARE, A LOT OF NUMBERS AHEAD**

# FAQ

**Q: Does this include qualifiers?** - No, only LANs

**Q: How did you gather stats?** - Using my LRG tool I made for myself. There's a github link in the footer, you can also check my reddit profile for LRG 1.3 post.

**Q: What is player's hero diversity?** - It means how many disctinct heroes the player had on average in a game. Or in what percentage of his matches he got a distinct hero.

**Q: What is a stomp and why X game isn't here?** - Stomp is an accumulated advantage without losing any part of it. It doesn't mean a team should win the game: biggest stomp just means this team had huge accumulated advantage against their enemies at some point.  Comeback is the same, but in opposite direction. You can comeback by networth, but still lose.

**Q: What is lane efficiency?** - Percentage of resources player got on the lane by 10 mins (comparing to all summary lane resources possible at 10 min mark). It's defined by OpenDota, I just use its value.
