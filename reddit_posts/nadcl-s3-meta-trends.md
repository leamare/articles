Spectral stats guy here. This post is based on data collected during season 3 of NADCL (didn't see that one coming, huh?)

A note from PPD about NADCL:

> We currently do not have any plans for a fourth season of @NADCLeague at the moment. It is possible that the league returns for a fourth season after TI9. 

> Our discord will remain open for chatting about games, dota, team recruitment, and news about NA qualifiers/tournaments.

> Happy to make this happen. I hope it was helpful.

> Shoutout to everyone who competed, casted, produced, watched, chatted in our discord, and enjoyed NADCL. I truly believe this is an important and necessary project.

It sure was a fun experience.
