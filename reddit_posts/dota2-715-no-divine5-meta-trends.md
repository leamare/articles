This data is based on Divine 5 Ranked Trends report for patch 7.15. It includes most of ranked matches that were played on Divine 5 rank in patch 7.15 (except ones that had abandons, ended in less than 10 minutes or had insignificantly low score).

Positions data may be inaccurate in some way (mostly so that very bad core games are counted as support while supports who had high stats and didn't spent much on support items may be considered core), but it's most likely to be insignificant.

Full report is available [here](https://spectralalliance.ru/reports/?league=div5_ranked_715). You can look through data by yourself if you want, maybe you'll find something interesting as well. There are more detailed data about Hero VS Hero performance, Draft stages priorities, pairs and trios, positions stats and dire/radiant winrates and Meta Graph.

# Short FAQ

* **Why so little matches played in REGION NAME?** On higher ranks it's common to queue for game on closest popular region. I.e. EUW for RU players, USE for USW.
* **Where did you get data?** I've got match IDs manually extracted from leaderboards players' recent matches.
* **What criteria are used?** Average rank for every game should be at least Divine 5. That's all.
* **Why there are only random draft matches played in China?** They just like playing random draft ever since DotA All-Stars days.
* **What does banned winrate mean?** It's winrate of a player (and his team) who nominated a hero for ban.
* **Can I see individual players stats somewhere?** Techically - yes. But there are too much players, reports are getting too big and unreadable because of that.
* **What is Outcome Impact (OI)?** It's special metric we came up at SA. The higher Outcome Impact value - the highest winrate and matches number hero has. Essentially it displays hero's power in current meta and is used for sorting heroes list. Outcome impact for draft stages is based only on this specific draft stage's stats.
* **What is Hero Pairs Divergence?** It's the difference between expected pair's matches and real match number. Usually this difference is higher for better hero combos.
