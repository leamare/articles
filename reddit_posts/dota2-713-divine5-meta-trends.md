Just a small note before the report. Our team of Spectral Alliance is coming to EPICENTER XL. If you are interested in our reports and toolset, what we are doing or just talk - look around for guys in "Spectral Alliance" hoodies (there will be our logos and nicknames on our backs: Leamare, Mio and Olej). You can also write a PM to me directly or contact us on our Discord server.

This data is based on Divine 5 Ranked Trends report for patches 7.13 and 7.13b. It includes most of 7.13 ranked matches that were played on Divine 5 rank in patches 7.13 and 7.13b (except ones that had abandons, ended in less than 10 minutes or had insignificantly low score).

Some matches may be missing because of missing replays. Replays of 597 matches were missing on dota servers. I skipped those matches since additional analysis of replays is required to get most of data.

It doesn't include Battle Cup matches, but let me know if you're interested in Battle Cup meta trends. Maybe I'll be able to grab those matches as well.

Positions data may be inaccurate in some way (mostly so that very bad core games are counted as support while supports who had high stats and didn't spent much on support items may be considered core), but it's most likely to be insignificant.

Full report is available [here](https://spectralalliance.ru/reports/?league=div5_ranked_713). You can look through data by yourself if you want, maybe you'll find something interesting as well. There are more detailed data about Hero VS Hero performance, Draft stages priorities, pairs and trios, positions stats and dire/radiant winrates.

# Short FAQ

* **Why so little matches played in REGION NAME?** On higher ranks it's common to queue for game on closest popular region. I.e. EUW for RU players, USE for USW.
* **Where did you get data?** I've got match IDs from OpenDota explorer and requested information for every each of those. Report is generated with my LRG tool.
* **What criteria are used?** Average rank for every game should be at least 75 (Divine 5 and higher). That's all.
* **Why there are no CM matches? Why there are only this amount of players?** CM inreases queue time because nobody plays CM. There aren't much players so every small thing affects queue time drastically.
* **Why there are only random draft matches played in China?** They just like playing random draft ever since DotA All-Stars days.
* **What does banned winrate mean?** It's winrate of a player (and his team) who nominated a hero for ban.
* **Can I see individual players stats somewhere?** Techically - yes. But there are too much players, reports are getting too big and unreadable because of that.

Previous report for patch 7.12: https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/8c6ktk/divine_5_meta_trends_712_edition/

I'd like to thank you for your feedback. It allowed me to make my tool way fancier and useful. I'd also like to thank /u/BirdieNZ for his "meaningful pairs" formula. I didn't have much time recently, but I have it working on staging version.

And thanks to OpenDota and STRATZ for providing awesome APIs to grab all juicy match analysis data and generate stats for all the matches.
