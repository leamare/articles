# Heroes

Just a quick note before we go: heroes in most contested list are sorted by "Rank". For those who are wondering how it's calculated: it's (wins_picked+wins_banned)/total_matches and then it's ranked by resulting value.

| Hero | Matches | Contest Rate | Rank | Matches Picked | Winrate Picked | Matches Banned | Winrate Banned |
|:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Weaver | 179 | 91.79% | 100.00 | 62 | 58.06% | 117 | 52.14%
| Enchantress | 184 | 94.36% | 99.10 | 34 | 55.88% | 150 | 47.33%
| Io | 173 | 88.72% | 98.20 | 33 | 39.39% | 140 | 50.00%
| Mirana | 140 | 71.79% | 97.30 | 74 | 54.05% | 66 | 65.15%
| Silencer | 165 | 84.62% | 96.40 | 58 | 50.00% | 107 | 47.66%
| Necrophos | 171 | 87.69% | 95.50 | 57 | 43.86% | 114 | 47.37%
| Tiny | 173 | 88.72% | 94.59 | 78 | 41.03% | 95 | 47.37%
| Wraith King | 129 | 66.15% | 93.69 | 66 | 51.52% | 63 | 53.97%
| Vengeful Spirit | 124 | 63.59% | 92.79 | 89 | 53.93% | 35 | 45.71%
| Broodmother | 109 | 55.90% | 91.89 | 18 | 66.67% | 91 | 53.85%

## First stage of draft

### Picks | Bans

| Hero | Matches Picked | Winrate Picked |  | Hero | Matches Banned | Winrate Banned |
|:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:--|:-:|:-:|
|Vengeful Spirit|68|50.0%| |Enchantress|144|47.2%

|Tiny|44|**40.9%**| |Weaver|94|52.1%
|Necrophos|43|**41.9%**| |Necrophos|89|47.2%

## Most picked hero pairs

This one is sorted by deviation - number of matches played over expected value.

| Heroes | Matches | Winrate | Expected matches | Deviation | Same lane rate
|:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
| Gyrocopter + Io | 21 | 47.62% | 2.9 | 18.1 (86.30%) | 95.24%
| Wraith King + Dark Willow | 26 | 61.54% | 11.2 | 14.8 (57.04%) | 73.08%
| Mirana + Vengeful Spirit | 24 | 66.67% | 16.9 | 7.1 (29.64%) | 70.83%
| Vengeful Spirit + Weaver | 21 | 47.62% | 14.1 | 6.9 (32.63%) | 76.19%
| Earthshaker + Silencer | 14 | 64.29% | 7.3 | 6.7 (47.95%) | 28.57%
| Silencer + Terrorblade | 9 | 66.67% | 2.5 | 6.5 (71.91%) | 55.56%

## Hero positions

| Safelane Core | Midlane Core | Offlane Core | Support |
| :--|:--|:--|:--|
| Spectre (32, **56.25%** wr) | Tiny (37, **29.73%**) | Wraith King (37, 54.05%) | Vengeful Spirit (85, 54.12%)
| Weaver (30, **56.67%** wr) | Lina (35, **60.00%**) | Mirana (34, **55.88%**) | Dark Willow (64, 54.69%)
| Phantom Lancer (29, **58.62%** wr) | Storm Spirit (34, 52.94%) | Weaver (31, **61.29%**) | Silencer (58, 50.00%)
| Mirana (27, **55.56%** wr) | Templar Assassin (25, 52.00%) | Enchantress (23, **65.22%**) | Crystal Maiden (52, 50.00%)
| Necrophos (25, **28.00%** wr) | Alchemist (23, 52.17%) | Ursa (21, **42.86%**) | Earthshaker (44, 63.64%)

Just want to note some things:

* I'm not going to discuss meta and why those heroes are pretty popular and strong right now (at least not here and not now), but I'd like to point out that most of heroes are much more diverse when it comes to safelane vs offlane. It all comes down to 2-1-2 laning and this idea of picking strong dual lane with midgame core to offlane (and dominate the lane) and picking another (usually lategame oriented) core to safelane (to suck and hope for a better future). That's mostly the reason why a lot of carries are now going to offlane and why WK is so popular here. That's also the reason of WK+DW combo being so popular
* Necrophos safelane winrate is some kind of a joke. Tiny mid as well

## Some of the highest average values

Limiter for average values was set to 4 (a little bit off Valve's limiter, but I guess it's not that big of a deal)

# Interesting facts

* In OG-EG series Notail and Fly have almost equal values of placed wards, but Notail destroyed almost two times more wards than Fly in the series. Notail loves to buy a lot of sentries, but who knows: maybe he just knows where his friend usually wards
* During TI8 there were 370685 creeps killed, 7108 Observer wards placed, 91 couriers killed and 413 Roshans killed
* There were 1299 buybacks
* TI8 was awesome (but you probably already know that)
* Resolut1on is for some reason still listed in OG roster. That's also why he got fetched as "OG.Resolut1on" for TI8 LAN reports
