This data is based on Divine 5 Ranked Trends report for patch 7.10. It includes every 7.10 ranked match that was played on Divine 5 rank in patch 7.10 (except ones that had abandons, ended in 5 minutes or had insignificantly low score).

Positions data may be inaccurate in some way (mostly so that very bad core games are counted as support while supports who had high stats and didn't spent much on support items may be considered core), but it's most likely to be insignificant.

# Short FAQ

* **Why so little matches played in REGION NAME?** On higher ranks it's common to queue for game on closest popular region. I.e. EUW for RU players, USE for USW.
* **Where did you get data?** I've got match IDs from OpenDota explorer and requested information for every each of those. Report is generated with my LRG tool.
* **What criteria are used?** Average rank for every game should be at least 75 (Divine 5 and higher). That's all.
* **Why there are no CM matches? Why there are only this amount of players?** CM inreases queue time because nobody plays CM. There aren't much players so every small thing affects queue time drastically.
* **Why there are only random draft matches played in China?** It seems like ever since "No All Pick" experiment, they switched to Random Draft.
* **What does banned winrate mean?** It's winrate of a player (and his team) who nominated a hero for ban.
