TL;DR: Hero builds project based around recent trends and high skilled players stats needs your feedback.

---

I guess some of you saw a lot of my recent stats reports/meta trends posts, but today I'd like to talk about Nerds Hero Builds project and ask for your help.

Everybody knows Torte De Lini and his Standart Hero Builds project, which influenced Dota 2 community a lot. While his hero builds system covers every hero in the game and provides basic guide for them, there's no real way to actually find good in-game guides for something untraditional or up-to-date builds.

There's where Nerds Hero Builds project comes in. Basic idea is to give players rather up-to-date builds, based on recent Divine 5 meta trends, or untraditional builds, which aren't recommended to play every game, but at least can give some guidance, how to make weird stuff work.

There are three basic ideas of every build:
- **No need to search through shop.** In other words, there are various items categories with alternative item replacements for every common situation, as well as multiple item build ways (for example, Arc Warden (Core) build suggests three different ways of building the hero, items in each category have commentaries with explanation, when it's better than others).
- **Timing windows.** It's usually hard to tell, when you are supposed to get an item, are you behind or not, and what you can afford. Altho, if you know timing windows for your core items, decision making process becomes slightly easier.
- **Stats and hero spammers.**  Every build is based on hero spammers' opinion, pro players' replays and stats. Sources are my own LRG tool (that I use for tournaments and divine 5 reports and meta trends posts), Dotabuff guides section, STRATZ hero stats and hero builds and Twitch (in combination with hero spammers' streams and their dotabuff profiles). Small changes are based on analytics, but usually they are updated based on actual trends. 

For example, offlane Dark Willow guide is built based on replays of Universe and IceIceIce (pro players), Haldor (ex. 2nd in Dotabuff player rankings), Crow (currently 48th) and mine (ex 48th). Crow and me (as well as some other Willow spamers) also discussed various item builds for both Roaming and Offlane Dark Willow and looked through STRATZ stats.

And that's the part where I stop explaining what it is and explain what I need your help for.

In fact, **I just need your feedback**, just to know is anybody actually interested in it or not.

Aside from that, there are two major problems that I'm facing right now:

1. **I'm not that good with item commentaries.** Recently I launched GitHub for *Nerds Hero Builds*, just so everybody can make a suggestion on how to change descriptions of items and abilities.
2. **It's hard to get into top builds list.** If a build can't get to the top builds list at least for English language, nobody will be able to find it. Some guides managed to get to top guides lists of their heroes, but it's more about luck.

Altho, it will be easier to deal with both of them if people know about the project. That's why I need your attention.
