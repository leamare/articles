## [Full Epicenter Major report](https://stats.spectral.gg/lrg2/?league=epicenter_major_2019_lan) - [Russian version](https://www.cybersport.ru/blog/post/302116/trendy-i-tsifry-epicenter-major)

# Meta

- **Total Matches played:** 97
- **Teams on event:** 16
- **Radiant winrate:** 56.70%
- **Median match duration:** 32:22

Slowly but surely average (and median) match duration got from 30-33 min mark (which became normal after 7.21 patch) to good old 38-40.

Aside from that we got another interesting trend that was discussed a lot after 7.22 release: high diversity of picks. The reason for that is lower value of early pressure and towers buff. It helped a lot of heroes find their place on the map and get enough space to shine. New aghs introduction also affected a lot of heroes and made them more efficient (hello, Ember Spirit) or made viable in some unexpected ways (thanks to longer games).

These trends became obvious at Epicenter Major like never before. We saw a lot of position diversity (for professional scene at least) and high picks diversity in general. While median picks and bans numbers remained the same as at ESL One Birmingham 2019, overall games number is higher by 10. What it means is heroes are smoothly distributed by their popularity.

With longer games we also saw the rise of teamfight heroes once again. Most notable mentions are Mars (21 picks, 28 bans, 61.9% winrate), Enigma (12 picks, 41 bans, 66.7% wr), Warlock (29 picks, 31 bans, 58.6% wr), Centaur Warrunner (35 picks, 16 bans, 62.9% wr). It's also worth to mention Sven and Templar Assassin: they aren't as 'teamfighty', but are still decent at it, while also being able to scale well into the lategame, take a role of tanky frontliners and take Roshan very efficiently.

One hell of a beast is Omniknight with 17 picks, 20 bans and 58.8% winrate, who became a great addition to many picks for any position thanks to his lategame potential and ability to turn any hero into tanky frontliner. Another notable mention is Gyrocopter + Io (13 picks, 61.5% winrate) who fit every trend altogether. Altho, it's mostly about Io who was banned 32 times while Gyro was banned just 0.

| Hero              | Matches | Contest Rate | Rank   | Picks | Winrate | Bans | Winrate |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------ | ------ | ----- | ------- | ---- | ------- |
| Mars              | 49      | 50.52%       | 100.00 | 21    | 61.90%  | 28   | 67.86%  |
| Templar Assassin  | 74      | 76.29%       | 99.09  | 26    | 61.54%  | 48   | 54.17%  |

| Centaur Warrunner | 51      | 52.58%       | 96.36  | 35    | 62.86%  | 16   | 43.75%  |

| Morphling         | 62      | 63.92%       | 92.73  | 16    | 43.75%  | 46   | 60.87%  |

### Most Picked | Most Banned

| Hero              | Matches | Picks | Winrate | -    | Hero             | Matches | Bans | Winrate |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- | ---- | ---------------- | ------- | ---- | ------- |
| Grimstroke        | 73      | 38    | 52.63%  |      | Sven             | 91      | 64   | 48.44%  |
| Centaur Warrunner | 51      | 35    | 62.86%  |      | Chen             | 76      | 62   | 45.16%  |
| Ember Spirit      | 70      | 34    | 50.00%  |      | Dark Seer        | 73      | 59   | 50.85%  |
| Warlock           | 60      | 29    | 58.62%  |      | Batrider         | 77      | 57   | 43.86%  |
| Sven              | 91      | 27    | 59.26%  |      | Templar Assassin | 74      | 48   | 54.17%  |

The new trend of the tournament was "creating opportunities" and "buying time". Great examples of this trend were Arc Warden's games. The hero not only delayed the games and was able to hold opponents and defend, but was able to buy enough time for his team. Another great example of such a hero is probably Earth Spirit.

Considering these heroes being popular, it won't be surprising for TI9 to be about these "long" heroes like Spectre, Anti-Mage, Medusa and the 4+1 strategies.

## Teams

It was just a regular day before the tournament. I was just looking at attendees list and thought it's pretty much obvious how it will end for everybody. It wasn't so obvious after all.

It was surprising to see Team Secret lose so early. Usually the team got the highest or one of the highest winrates on al the recent tournaments and got the first places. It was expected to see from the DPC's first place. I guess people are paying a lot of attention to DPC leaders and try to beat Team Secret and Virtus.pro.

One hell of performance was shown by Team Liquid. Even while TI7 champions are the 5th DPC team and had a roster change just before the tournament, it seems like the change wasn't that bad of an idea. The playstyle of w33 fits the team perfectly and creates a lot of opportunities for Miracle- to show off his full potential.

But who cares about these first places and DPC leaders? The most interesting teams at the event are probably TNC Predator, Alliance and Gambit Esports. Those teams were never considered as the champions of the tournament. But they not only gave us some of the most memorable matches of the tournament, but of the whole DPC season. After the tournament those teams got 6th, 8th and 10th places by Elo rating on datDota. It's a little bit sad to see Gambit fail to get the TI invitation but I guess nobody doubts they are going to get regional qualifications slot for themselves. TNC and Alliance on the other hand got just enough points to hold their positions in the DPC table and got to the main tournament of the year by showing how strong they are.

Altho, the scariest team of the season right now is probably Vici Gaming. The chinese team holds the third place by DPC points and has the highest Elo rating on datDota. The team's strategies and playstyle combine perfectly with the current meta. It may be the reason of extremely high attention to VG, but the team is still strong enough to bring it on.
