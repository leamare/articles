Spectral guy here. Yet another first-week-report. There is also NADCL Season 3 post in works. Not sure about major qualifiers, let me know if you're interested.

This post is based on data collected during the first week of patch 7.21d. This report includes not only ranked data, but stats of all matches with average rank equal to Immortal. Excluded matches are the ones that had abandons, ended in less than 10 minutes or had insignificantly low score (or it was impossible to get detailed draft data for them).

Positions data may be inaccurate in some way (mostly so that very bad core games are counted as support while supports who had high stats and didn't spent much on support items may be considered core), but it's most likely to be insignificant.

There's something off about draft stages at the moment, just ignore it for now.

[Full report is available here](https://spectralalliance.ru/reports/?league=imm_ranked_721d). You can look through data by yourself if you want, maybe you'll find something interesting as well. There are more detailed data about Hero VS Hero performance, Draft stages priorities, pairs and trios, positions stats and dire/radiant winrates, Meta Graph and region specific data. The report will be updated semi-weekly (sort of).

# Short FAQ

* **Why so little matches played in REGION NAME?** On higher ranks it's common to queue for game on closest popular region. I.e. EUW for RU players, USE for USW.
* **Where did you get data?** I've got match IDs manually extracted from leaderboards players' recent matches using STRATZ API. Then I fetch match data using mostly OpenDota API.
* **Why there are only random draft matches played in China?** They just like playing random draft ever since DotA All-Stars days.
* **What does banned winrate mean?** It's winrate of a player (and his team) who nominated a hero for ban.
* **Can I see individual players stats somewhere?** Techically - yes. But there are too much players, reports are getting too big and unreadable because of that. Also privacy stuff.
* **What is Hero Pairs Divergence?** It's the difference between expected pair's matches and real match number. Usually this difference is higher for better hero combos.
* **What is Hero Rank?** Think of it as of smart winrate sort. It considers popularity and winrate of heroes.
* **Is it strictly Immortal Rank?** Not for now, there may be some random individual divine players here and there. Altho, an "Immortal Rank" match is usually the match with at least 9 immortal players in it.

Some of those are affected by turbo matches as well, but I found it out too late, so I just marked them. Sorry for that.
