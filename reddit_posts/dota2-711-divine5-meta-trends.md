This data is based on Divine 5 Ranked Trends report for patch 7.11. It includes every 7.11 ranked match that was played on Divine 5 rank in patch 7.10 (except ones that had abandons, ended in 5 minutes or had insignificantly low score).

It doesn't include Battle Cup matches, but let me know if you're interested in Battle Cup meta trends. Maybe I'll be able to grab those matches as well.

Positions data may be inaccurate in some way (mostly so that very bad core games are counted as support while supports who had high stats and didn't spent much on support items may be considered core), but it's most likely to be insignificant.

I'd recommend to check full report by yourself since there are also hero summary and hero averages data that may be interesting for you.

# Short FAQ

* **Why so little matches played in REGION NAME?** On higher ranks it's common to queue for game on closest popular region. I.e. EUW for RU players, USE for USW.
* **Where did you get data?** I've got match IDs from OpenDota explorer and requested information for every each of those. Report is generated with my LRG tool.
* **What criteria are used?** Average rank for every game should be at least 75 (Divine 5 and higher). That's all.
* **Why there are no CM matches? Why there are only this amount of players?** CM inreases queue time because nobody plays CM. There aren't much players so every small thing affects queue time drastically.
* **Why there are only random draft matches played in China?** It seems like ever since "No All Pick" experiment, they switched to Random Draft.
* **What does banned winrate mean?** It's winrate of a player (and his team) who nominated a hero for ban.
* **Can I see individual players stats somewhere?** Techically - yes. But there are too much players, reports are getting too big and unreadable because of that.

# Summary

* **Matches total:** 2394
* **Players in matches:** 8426
* **Radiant winrate:** 52.88%
* **Average match duration:** 34:55
* **Total buybacks:** 9485

There is something weird regarding games-per-day chart. It seems like there was a huge drop at 16th of March and 17th is missing. Altho, it may be related to missing replays of those games.

### Game Modes

* **All Draft:** 84.21% (2016)
* **Random Draft:** 15.79% (378) - There was 377 matches played in China, so it seems like one RD match was played somewhere else.

### Regions

* **Europe West:** 964
* **Southeast Asia:** 599
* **China:** 377
* **US East:** 304
* **Europe East:** 71

## Notable positions

* Nobody really plays support Visage anymore: 38 matches, 36.84% winrate. Thank god.
* Visage lost a lot of winrate from patch to patch, but still holds its solid 57-58%. Recently pro players started practicing offlane Visage again which led to 17 matches and 64.71% winrate.
* Another interesting trend that was here for a while now: offlane Death Prophet. While there aren't many matches in report this patch, I saw myself it being pretty popular in CIS and Europe practice matches between teams.
* Dark Willow core offlane is 8th most popular hero for this position now: 158 matches and 65.19% winrate (24.31% of DW matches)


## Notable Meta shifts

* It's not in reports, but I've got this data for my friend's research about consequenses of buyback formula change. Average buyback count in 7.11 is way higher for supports, while cores fell out a lot in this regard. Io has one of the highest average buybacks value.
* Bristleback became pretty popular recently. He's not in top 10 offlane cores list, but he's pretty close to it with 87 matches and 42.53% winrate
* Dark Willow is 3rd most contested hero with solid 54% winrate (13th before)
* Tusk became more popular as well: 4th most contested from 10th
* It seems like Gyrocopter got everybody sick of him: he dropped from 3rd place to 11th
* Terrorblade dropped even lower: 17th place now
