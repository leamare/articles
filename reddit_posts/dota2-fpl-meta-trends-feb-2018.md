A little bit late, but still here: montly stats for FaceIT Pro League matches.

This data is based on FPL stats report for February 2018. It includes every match that was played in FaceIT Pro League (excluding those that couldn't been found).

Positions data may be inaccurate in some way (mostly so that very bad core games are counted as support while supports who had high stats and didn't spent much on support items may be considered core), but it's most likely to be insignificant.

Thanks to FaceIT guys, it's now possible to fetch match IDs from Dota 2 API, so I didn't need to manually find every single match like I did before. Altho, matches from the first two weeks didn't have the right league ID and some matches (around 10-15) weren't available in FaceIT web interface, so I couldn't find them.

Edit: Holy shtuff, front page and 90 upvotes in less than two hours! Thank you guys!
