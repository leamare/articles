This data is based on Divine 5 Ranked Trends report for patch 7.08. It includes every 7.08 ranked match that was played on Divine 5 rank in patch 7.08 (except ones that had abandons, ended in 5 minutes or had insignificantly low score).

Positions data may be inaccurate in some way (mostly so that very bad core games are counted as support while supports who had high stats and didn't spent much on support items may be considered core), but it's most likely to be insignificant.
