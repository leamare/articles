This data is based on Divine 5 Ranked Trends report for patch 7.09. It includes every 7.09 ranked match that was played on Divine 5 rank in patch 7.09 (except ones that had abandons, ended in 5 minutes or had insignificantly low score).

Positions data may be inaccurate in some way (mostly so that very bad core games are counted as support while supports who had high stats and didn't spent much on support items may be considered core), but it's most likely to be insignificant.

And another note, thanks to everybody who left their feedback in my ["ESL One Katowice 2018 Meta Graph" thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/808qln/esl_one_katowice_meta_graph/). It helped a lot with fixing various small bugs with hero combos stats and improving graphs.

## Notable positions

* Razor was played as safelane core in 68% of his matches, having 50.71% winrate. Altho, In 19.95% of matches he was played as midlane core and has 39% winrate
* Zeus was more stable in previous patch: no winrate shifts between various positions, solid 49-51% on mid, offlane and as support (and 83% winrate as safelane core, but it's probably lane swaps)
* Enigma had 59% winrate on offlane in 7.09
* Somebody played jungle venomancer: 2 matches, 50% winrate
* Wraith King is more fun tho: 20 matches as jungling core (14.71% of all his matches) and 40% winrate. 15 matches as support (roaming support and supporting junglers are here too) with 66% winrate. Recently somebody started a trend of playing jungle support WK with helm of the dominator, probably related to this stuff
* Mid and offlane DK have both 53% winrate
* Clinkz wasn't really popular in 7.09, but he has 55% as safelane core and 58% as midlane core
* Similar situation with Huskar: almost the same amount of matches, 61% winrate as safelane core and 68% winrate as midlane core
* Offlane Chen: 48 matches and 70.83% winrate monkaS
* Somebody still plays support Visage: 33 matches, 39% winrate. Safelane Core Visage has 16 matches and 75% winrate, Midlane Visage has 49 matches and 61% winrate. There's even Offlane Visage with 13 matches and 76% winrate

## Notable Meta shifts

* Rubick: +4% winrate
* Queen of Pain: +5% winrate
* Juggernaut: +5% winrate
* Average neutral stacks value shifted a bit to support side, way less cores in list now
* Lycan and Phantom Lancer dropped from top-5 safelane cores. Their places were taken by Terrorblade and Lifestealer (with this new radiance trend, I believe)
* No significant changes to midlane top heroes
* Offlane Omniknight winrate drop from 61% to 51%
* Pangolier and Sand King dropped out a bit from top-5 offlane cores list, Beastmaster rises
* Antimage wasn't really popular. He didn't even get through the hero averages list threshold, so now Lifestealer has the least deaths
* Significantly more popular: Terrorblade, Naga Siren, Gyrocopter, Lifestealer, Razor, Dragon Knight, Beastmaster, Witch Doctor,
* Significantly less popular: Anti-mage, Lycan, Night Stalker, Phantom Lancer, Nyx Assassin
