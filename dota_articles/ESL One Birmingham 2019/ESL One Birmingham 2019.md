With the start of new patch we got to territory of a new unsolved meta. ESL One Birmingham was the first major level tournament that was played on patch 7.22 as well as the first tournament to start shaping competitive meta we are most likely to see at The International 2019. Team Secret took the title in Birmingham as their season of success continued and they racked up some pretty impressive stats along the way. Based on the tournament match data and statistics, let’s see what we learned...

## Heroes

Aside from Aghanim’s Scepter updates, the 7.22 patch didn’t affect overall meta that much. Two major changes I personally expected to see after reading patchnotes are:

- Early domination to be less important leading to more ways to come back into the game and longer games overall
- Huge impact of Rosh-heavy heroes
- Heroes with strong Aghs and teamfight presence to be generally more important
- Huge diversity in hero picks and positions, especially on a professional level where unusual strategies may be easier to perform

One of the things to be expected based off these thoughts for me were huge contest rates of Sven and Spectre. Both of those heroes have massive teamfighting potential and pretty tanky by themselves.

Another hero to consider is Lone Druid who didn’t get to top-10 heroes of the event, but has considerably high rank of 78.50. One thing those heroes (and Troll Warlord, who is popular enough to mention him, but not successful enough to give him any more attention) have in common is they are making their team tankier in some way while being position one heroes and not lacking damage or sustain in any way: attack damage shield, Radiance miss chance, even Whirling Axes.

Another thing to notice is expected diversity of the tournament’s meta, even tho it may be a consequense of unsolveness of the meta. And while a lot of heroes got enough attention, two heroes stand out being contested in 85 matches out of 87: Io and Chen.

Both of these heroes have high skill cap and not that popular in pubs, but of them got rellatively recent big buffs which made them not only much easier to play, but also turned both of these heroes into nightmare to play against on pro level. While Io already got a lot of nerfs, the ball is still getting a lot of bans during most events, and Chen seems to be pretty close to being the new Io.
