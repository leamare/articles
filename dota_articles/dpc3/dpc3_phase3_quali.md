# DPC Meta Trends - DreamLeague Season 13 and WePlay! Bukovel Minor qualifiers recap

Some spectral dude with some spectral stats here.

There are a lot of matches with missing replays so it affected some data (like positions stats and other stuff).

The post is based on the automatically generated report with a bunch of cool stats available. You can check it out and find even more data here: https://stats.spectral.gg/lrg2/?league=pro_circuit_19_20_qualis_p2

And talking about report for Immortal Rank Meta Trends for 7.23(a/b): I'm gathering last portion of matches and as soon as the process ends I'm going to make a post. A report for 7.23c is going to be generated after ~1 day of the patch.

# Heroes

* **Median picks:** 26
* **Median bans:** 27
* **Median hero GPM:** 418
* **Median hero XPM:** 556

It’s interesting to note that median XPM is higher by almost 50 compared to Major+Minor report. I think it may be related to people figuring out how broken Outposts XP is and playing around that. Or maybe not, it’s up to you to decide.

## Hero Positions

I’m including hero positions stats here. However there are some (a lot) matches that are missing replays (and analysis) so I can’t use them to count all the matches. While a lot of matches aren’t included in the data, these stats may still give some insights. Just keep this in mind while looking at the numbers. Heroes were sorted by the number of matches.

|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Gyrocopter (28, 46.4% wr, 91.4 rank) | Templar Assassin (29, 37.9% wr, 76 rank) | Abaddon (30, 36.7% wr, 73.8 rank) |Crystal Maiden (58, 55.2% wr, 93.1 rank)|
| Ursa (23, 60.9% wr, 94.8 rank) | Ember Spirit (25, 52% wr, 90 rank) | Legion Commander (27, 44.4% wr, 87.7 rank) |Rubick (56, 64.3% wr, 100 rank)|
| Morphling (20, 35% wr, 69 rank ~~nice~~) | Invoker (22, 40.9% wr, 74 rank) | Centaur Warrunner (24, 58.3% wr, 95.4 rank) |Vengeful Spirit (36, 55.6% wr, 89.7 rank)|
| Weaver (16, 50% wr, 86.2 rank)           | Shadow Fiend (21, 52.4% wr, 86 rank) | Beastmaster (23, 56.5% wr, 93.8 rank) |Tusk (35, 34.3% wr, 60.3 rank)|
| Phantom Lancer (15, 53.3% wr, 89.7 rank) | Razor (21, 47.6% wr, 82 rank) | Omniknight (22, 72.7% wr, 100 rank) |Disruptor (28, 53.6% wr, 86.2 rank)|
