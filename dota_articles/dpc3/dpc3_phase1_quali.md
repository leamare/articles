# DPC Meta Trends - DOTA Summit 11 and MDL Chengdu Major

Heya there, spectral stats guy strikes again. New season has started and we already have the first minor/major results.

A small update before the most interesting part begins. I updated reports structure for this season a little bit on the Spectral Hub. From this point onward and until I finish my work with Simon there will be following reports for this competitive season:

* big report for all the competitive LANs, including both DPC and major non-DPC events
* big report for all the DPC LANs of the season
* reports for qualifiers
* reports for DPC and major non-DPC LAN events
* reports for DPC “phases” – pairs of minor and major LANs

This report is based on the first phase of the DPC season. You can check all the stats from the reports here:

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ---------- | -------------- |

The fact that NS + KotL combo is one of the most popular ones may teach us a valuable lesson: even the hardest sin may be forgiven. After all, KotL brutally murdered the whole Night Stalker’s race and yet they are together.

## Hero Positions

I’m including hero positions stats here. However there are some matches that are missing replays (and analysis) so I can’t use them to count all the matches. Just keep this in mind. Heroes were sorted by the number of matches.

|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Faceless Void (31, 54.8% wr) | Templar Assassin (21, 52.4% wr) | Legion Commander (20, 35% wr) |Keeper of the Light (40, 50% wr)|
| Gyrocopter (27, 59.3% wr) | Invoker (18, 33.3% wr) | Sand King (19, 52.6% wr) |Rubick (35, 60% wr)|
| Chaos Knight (16, 50% wr) | Outworld Devourer (17, 41.2% wr) | Centaur Warrunner (17, 47.1% wr) |Mirana (34, 52.9% wr)|
| Drow Ranger (16, 50% wr) | Gyrocopter (14, 50% wr) | Abaddon (13, 61.5% wr) |Ogre Magi (32, 65.9% wr)|
| Night Stalker (15, 66.7% wr) | Ember Spirit (12, 58.3% wr) | Tiny (10, 60% wr) |Lich (32, 46.9% wr)|

And that’s pretty much it.

I didn’t include my personal analysis here this time since I couldn’t really watch the tournaments myself and as much as I’d like to write my *analytics* based on numbers I don’t think it’s necessary.

Feel free to ask any questions you have in comments. Or you may also check out a [FAQ page I made for the stats hub](https://spectral.gg/?stats_faq).

Thanks to OpenDota and Stratz for their awesome APIs. Happy new patch everyone!
