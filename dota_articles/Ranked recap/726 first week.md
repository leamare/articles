# Immortal Meta Trends – first week of 7.26(a)

This report is based on data collected during the first days of the patches 7.26 and 7.26a. Data includes not only ranked matches, but stats of all matches with average rank equal to Immortal. Excluded matches are the ones that have abandons, ended in less than 10 minutes or had an insignificantly low score.

[The full and regularly-updated version of the report is available at Spectral.gg](https://stats.spectral.gg/lrg2/?league=imm_ranked_726). You can find detailed data about Hero-vs-Hero performance, draft stages priorities, pairs and trios, positions stats and dire/radiant winrates, Meta Graph and region-specific data here and all the other values.

There’s also a short [FAQ page I made for this reports](https://spectral.gg/?stats_faq).

And you can check out [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/ileamare) or my [Discord](https://discord.spectral.gg/). I write about new reports and stats here a lot, you can also suggest/discuss some things here (and there are also some other curious things you can find in my twitter, like my small experiments or podcast about dota).

## Heroes

Usually I add some context by comparing current patch to the previous one, but there were so much meta shifts recently that I guess it will be better to just list everything as is.

And usually I just write down median picks/bans somewhere and use real numbers in the tables, but this time I want to add some new values in the table:

* **1mp** means 1 * median of picks
* **1mb** means 1 * median of bans
* The big numbers are the real ones

I was messing around with this mp/mb thing for a while now and it seems to be easier to understand a hero’s popularity level.

And you can check all the values in the complete report if you want.

Just a quick note: based on numbers alone it seems like the meta isn’t really that different from previous patches up to 7.25, and compared to 7.24/7.22 it seems to be much more diverse. But, of course, the real picture is a bit more complicated and it’s only Immortal rank pubs.

Feel free to ask any questions you have in comments. You may also check out a [FAQ page I made for the stats hub](https://spectral.gg/?stats_faq) or join my discord and ask questions or leave suggestions here.

I also set up some new ongoing reports for major leagues that are going on right now, as well as set up some automatics to fetch ranked data on a daily basis (so the ranked report is updated daily now, with 1 day delay). You can also check my twitter and discord for suggestions and some posts about new reports.

And thanks to OpenDota and Stratz for their awesome APIs once again.
