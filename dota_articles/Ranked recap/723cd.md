# 7.23(c/d) Immortal Meta Trends

This report is based on data collected during patches 7.23c and 7.23d. Data includes not only ranked matches, but stats of all matches with lowest rank to be Immortal. Excluded matches are the ones that have abandons, ended in less than 10 minutes or had an insignificantly low score.

[The full report is available at Spectral.gg](https://stats.spectral.gg/lrg2/?league=imm_ranked_723c). You can find detailed data about Hero-vs-Hero performance, draft stages priorities, pairs and trios, positions stats and dire/radiant winrates, Meta Graph and region-specific data here.

There’s also a [7.23e report](https://stats.spectral.gg/lrg2/?league=imm_ranked_723e) available as well as a short [FAQ page I made for this reports](https://spectral.gg/?stats_faq). I didn’t include the 7.23e data here yet but I added some insights that I found to be interesting.

## Summary

* **Matches total:** 12,008 (7.23c – 7,912, 7.23d – 4,096)
* **Radiant winrate:** 52.61% (in 7.23e it lowered by 1.9% which may be the result of shrines change; I guess main jungle shrines matter much more than I expected – initially I thought about triangle shrine on Radiant side being a significant advantage)
* **Median match duration:** 33:01 (35:28 in 7.22h, 33:01 in 7.23(a/b) and 34:27 in 7.23e)
* **Median hero picks:** 715
* **Median hero bans:** 96
* **Median hero GPM/XPM:** 423/569 (420/542 in 7.22h, 436/610 in 7.23(a/b), 412/534 in 7.23e)
* **Total courier kills:** 31,408 (averaging to 2.6 couriers killed per game)

### Game Modes

* **Ranked All Pick:** 9,348
* **Random Draft:** 2,305
* **Captains Mode:** 338
* **All Pick:** 8
* **Single Draft:** 5
* **Captains Draft:** 5
* **All Random:** 1

I made 7.23 report without a new rank filter so it still has games with 7-9 immortal players and some divines. However even in 7.23c report there’s a noticeable increase in unranked specific game modes popularity. 

### Regions

* **Europe West:** 4,624
* **China:** 2,512
* **Southeast Asia:** 2,208
* **US East:** 1,316
* **Russia and CIS:** 704
* **Europe East:** 493
* **South America:** 76
* **Australia:** 27
* **Peru:** 21
* **US West:** 11
* **Japan:** 8
* **Chile:** 8

**Least contested:** Death Prophet, Dark Seer, Sniper, Visage, Medusa, Arc Warden, Tidehunter, Spectre, Alchemist, Riki, Enigma

Most of 7.23e heroes in top-10 list are the same. It’s interesting to note that Void Spirit lost more than 8% of winrate (58.3% -> 49.84%). Treant lost almost 3% (53.94% -> 51.21%), Doom and Venge got higher (3% winrate each) and others are pretty much the same. However, Batrider, PL and Venomancer got replaced by Puck, Meepo and Huskar.
